Tektronix CSA803C is a Digital Sampling Oscilloscope from 1990s. Naturally it has no networking or USB interface but it has a very flexible hardcopy feature that can send the screenshot to a printer or to COM port (or GPIB).

This (listen.py) is a small utility listening on COM port connected to CSA803C, captures the data when hardcopy key is pressed, and saves it to a folder. I am using this utility on a Raspberry Pi and saving the images to a samba share, so I can access the screenshots directly from Windows etc.
